# Getting started with the DeepFace API

This project was created with the [DeepFace API](https://github.com/serengil/deepface)

## What is DeepFace

Deepface is a facial recognition framework for Python. DeepFace allows one to conduct facial analysis on a face, where DeepFace would detail the age, gender, emotion, and race based off the face given to DeepFace.

## Installation

To install DeepFace, RUN the command "pip install deepface".

For other installation methods, refer to these [instructions](https://github.com/serengil/deepface).

# Getting Started with Docker

This project utilizies the software platform [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## What is Docker

Docker is a software service platoform where it simplifies the process of building, running, and managing applications. Docker does this by creating containers where containers packages code and their dependicies so the applicaiton can run efficiently across all computing environments.

## Building Docker

In order to build a container within docker, run the command "$ docker build [OPTIONS] PATH | URL".

In this command, "PATH" refers to the specific location of files for the "context" of the build and "URL" refers to a link to the "context of the build". This command can use either of these "context" to build the container. To build a container a specific way, refer to other [OPTIONS](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#tag-an-image--t)

It is also possible to copy a specific file if one wants to copy only one file. In order to do this, follow the prompt **COPY --from**, where "**from**" is the specific file you want to copy.

## Running Docker

One way to run Docker with a program, is to write "docker compose up -d" within the terminal to open the Docker container.

Another way to open a Docker container is to open the specific containers within the Docker app while running a program.
